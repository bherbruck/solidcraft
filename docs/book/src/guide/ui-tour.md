# A tour of the window

![The SolidCraft window](../generated/sample-plate.png)

- **Title bar.** On Windows and Linux the application bar is the window's title bar. On the left:
  the File menu (New, Open, Save, Save As, Export…), undo and redo, the Home tab (the start page)
  and one tab per open design (each with its own undo history, selection and camera; a dot marks
  unsaved changes). On the right: Report a bug, Help (?), Preferences (which hold the theme) and the
  window's buttons.
- **Toolbar.** The workspace switcher (DESIGN) sits on the left. The tabs (MODEL, SURFACE,
  ASSEMBLE, INSERT, INSPECT, MANAGE and VIEW) hold sections of commands. SKETCH appears while
  editing a sketch; SHEET METAL appears for the active sheet body. Both select automatically
  when entered, and the other tabs remain available. Click a
  panel's name for all its commands. Drag a command from the dropdown onto a panel's label
  or empty space to append it; the insertion line shows its destination. Drop onto an existing
  button to insert before it. Buttons can also move between panels, and the layout is saved.
- **Browser** (left). The design as a tree: document settings and units, named views, the
  origin, bodies, sketches, construction planes, canvases, joints and components. The eye shows or
  hides an item, a component's radio button makes it the active component, and right-clicking any
  row gives that item's menu. Rows drag into groups and other components.
- **Viewport.** Click to select, Shift or Ctrl to add, drag for a window or crossing box. To
  reach something under something else (two lines drawn on top of each other, coincident points,
  an edge in front of a face, overlapping bodies), hold the left button still for half a second
  (long-press on a touch screen) or right-click › **Select Other…**: a list of everything under
  the cursor opens there, the sketch being edited first. Hovering a row lights it up; clicking it
  selects it (Shift or Ctrl adds), and in a command's dialog it goes to the active selection box.
  Esc or a click elsewhere closes the list. Clicking again on the same spot, with nothing changed
  in between, selects the next thing in that list. The
  wheel zooms at the cursor, the middle button pans and right-drag orbits freely (the mouse
  preset in Preferences switches to SolidWorks, Inventor, Alias, Blender, Tinkercad, OpenSCAD or Touchpad style). On a
  trackpad, pinch zooms and two-finger scroll pans (Navigation › Two-finger scroll pans;
  off: scroll zooms like the wheel); mouse wheels zoom and the thumb wheel pans sideways.
  Shift+middle orbits freely
  in the default and Inventor presets. In every preset, Ctrl+left drag (Cmd on macOS) that starts
  on empty space orbits; a Ctrl+click still adds to the selection. Shift+right-drag snaps to the nearest standard or
  diagonal view; Shift does not request snapping when the preset already requires it to orbit.
  With **Touchpad** selected in Preferences › Navigation, hold **Shift** and move the pointer to
  pan, or hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) and move it to orbit—no mouse button is needed.
  Vertical two-finger scrolling zooms in this preset, regardless of the saved two-finger pan
  setting; switching presets restores that setting. Release the modifier to stop navigating.
  Shift+click and Shift+left-drag still select. Combined Shift+Alt or Ctrl/Cmd modifiers do not
  start pointer-only navigation.
  The axis view shows the world's X/Y/Z directions in SolidCraft's colors. Click a signed
  axis tip to look along that axis; click the aligned tip again to look from the opposite side.
  Drag the axis view to orbit around the view centre, with Shift for snapping. Top and bottom
  keep the nearest quarter-turn heading. The house, the navigation bar's Home button and a middle-button double-click in the view go
  home, framing what is shown now (Navigation › **Middle double-click** can make it Fit, which
  keeps the orientation, or turn it off).
  Right-click for the marking menu: eight commands around the cursor, plus a
  menu for whatever is under it. Near the window's bottom or right edge a menu opens above or
  to the left of the cursor, so it stays in view.
  Shaded views omit certified smooth joins between spline spans on extruded
  walls. Real creases, cap outlines and authored face splits remain visible.
  Wireframe retains its edge presentation, and hiding a join does not remove its CAD
  identity or change the exported solid. Unsupported or uncertain wall geometry
  keeps its existing edge presentation.
- **Dialogs** dock on the right with a live preview. Most features also show drag handles and a
  value box in the viewport.
- **Timeline** (bottom). Every feature in order. Double-click to edit, drag the marker to roll
  back, and drag features to reorder them.
- **S box.** Press S anywhere for a command search at the cursor. Pin the commands you use most
  to its top.

Preferences (File › Preferences) hold the theme, the units of new designs, the mouse preset, the
visual style and autosave. Graphics › Colour vision gives the colours that carry a meaning (sketch
states, axes, bends, analyses, icons) values for a weak red, green or blue sense: Protan, Deutan or
Tritan. In a mode, the faces Draft and Accessibility Analysis mark as failing are striped too.
Help › Keyboard Shortcuts lists every key, and File › Keyboard
Shortcuts changes them.

Navigation › **Smooth wheel zoom** is on by default. Turn it off to apply each wheel or
trackpad event immediately, with no smoothing tail. It is independent of **Animate view
changes**, which controls axis views, Look At, Home and Fit. Re-enabling smoothing during
a wheel gesture takes effect after that gesture ends, avoiding leftover zoom being replayed.

Navigation › **Alias** uses Alias's camera keys: Shift+Alt+left drag orbits, Shift+Alt+middle
drag pans and Shift+Alt+right drag zooms (drag down to move away, up to move closer). Without
Shift+Alt, a left drag still selects with a box and drags sketch geometry.

Some Linux desktops take Alt+drag for themselves (moving or resizing windows), so the viewport
never sees it. To free it:

- **KDE Plasma:** System Settings › Window Management › Window Behavior › Window Actions, set
  **Modifier key** to Meta (or None).
- **GNOME:** run `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences mouse-button-modifier '<Super>'`
  (or set Tweaks › Windows › Window Action Key to Super).

Shift-orbit snapping includes 45-degree edge views and isometric corner views, with a
lightly damped spring transition and a small boundary margin to prevent flicker.

On desktop, Ctrl/Cmd+Plus (or Equals) enlarges the interface, Ctrl/Cmd+Minus reduces it,
and Ctrl/Cmd+0 restores 100%. These shortcuts update the UI scale preference. The UI scale
slider in Preferences applies the new layout when released, so it stays still while dragging.
